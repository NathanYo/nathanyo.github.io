# List of Projects

[Algorithms][algo] is code I am creating as I complete Coursera's [Algorithms: Design and Analysis][coursera].

[Pokemon-Go-Outside][pogo] is a fork of the [Cloud-to-Butt][ctb] Chrome extension that replaces "Pokemon Go" with "going outside".

[Verb the Noun Bot][verb] was my final project for my introduction to computer science course. Very basic code that is inefficient because it is from an introductory course where we learned C/C++. 
The project was written in Python 2.7 using the [tweepy][tweepy] library.

# Private Projects

Most of my private repositories are source code for my university courses. I am going to modify them so they can be used as a resource soon...
