### What is char-rnn?

[char-rnn][char-rnn] is a method of utilizing LTSM Recurrent Neural Networks. I've spent this week playing around with Tensorflow, so I used the [Tensorflow implementation][char-rnn-tf]
so I could learn more while playing with other's code. Recurrent neural networks are very powerful tools (I strongly recommend reading [this blogpost][0] and 
[this blogpost][1], as well as [this Two-Minute-Papers video][2]) for handling text and many, many more things. I decided to let it take a data set of lyrics from my
favorite bands and try generating song lyrics.

### Motivation

I have been a musician for a very large portion of my life, but I have always stuggled with writing the lyrics of songs. If I train a neural net to do the heavy lifting,
I would be able to ease that part of song writing.

### The First (Hilarious) Attempts

My first run through was pretty bad becuase I created a net with too large of a batch size. I used a batch_size of 55 with 3 layers. It created some jumbled
results that would be very interesting to hear as a song.

The Generated Lyrics:

I'm taking, it's will redem on

And we were better air home

We had to know

The end I be gonna lips around, and my hell

I stand nowing for restame enough it

And the places that this all pretty as nark

Stayed myself into the dark

And it's all so far up down

We're on a reabled up or and so don't least care

What aches your legs wake

But they want me write everything

And I have to those who your mean

You just don't care but the door

And when she, bye, bye, bye, really for the nag. 

Say about look songs

I'd be good, and og clame it

Well all my swem and said to me

And when you talked up

Like town, tired every right. 

But what the way we still not so I can stuped for us to high

and we're waiting flie.

And year enough your say there

Who Xcom, you throw yourself

Who was it all they stayed out your lovery.

So not the  best thing in the world. The interesting thing is it is using actual words sometimes, and it created a Oh-Oh-Oh that has a tendency to happen in songs.
It probably hasn't seen enough parentheses to know to close its parentheses.

Another interesting trend is how the net has a tendency to start sentences with words like but, say, you, I, etc. which is a common occurrence in the lyrics I fed it.

I will update this post after a bit when I've trained a more effective method.
