My name is Nathan Yocum. Welcome to my [Github][Github] page and general purpose blog. I am an undergraduate studying computer science and engineering at the [University of Nevada, Reno][cse].
I am interested in machine learning, algorithm design and analysis, robotics, and human-computer interaction. I am an undergraduate research assistant in the [robotics research lab][rrl] at the University of Nevada.

### What this page is for

I will be using this page to highlight my projects and to host resources I will use for teaching concepts I am learning either on my own or in courses.
I will also use this for the ocassional blog post for more general things.

### Some miscellaneous stuff

A bit more about me: I was in the University of Nevada marching band for two years of my undergraduate degree, where I played tuba. Music is a big part of my life personally, and is a big reason I went in to computer science.

I am also a very involved member on campus, participating in [ACM][acm], IEEE, and Nevada Robotics Society.
